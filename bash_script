cONTAIN THE THE THREE SCRIPT THAT ARE 
Health_check.sh

 What Does health_check.sh Do?
The script performs a series of checks to assess the system's health. These checks can include:​

CPU Usage: Monitoring the current CPU load to detect potential performance issues.

Memory Usage: Checking available and used memory to prevent out-of-memory situations.

Disk Space: Ensuring that disk usage is within acceptable limits to avoid storage shortages.

Service Status: Verifying that critical services (e.g., web servers, databases) are running as expected.

Network Connectivity: Testing network interfaces and external connectivity to detect outages.

Application Endpoints: Sending requests to application endpoints to confirm they respond correctly.​

backup_api.sh
application's files and databases, ensuring that data is preserved and can be restored in case of system failures or data loss.
By automating this process, the script helps maintain regular backups without manual intervention,
enhancing data reliability and recovery capabilities.​

Typically, the script performs tasks such as compressing the API's source code and related files into a .tar.gz archive,
exporting the application's database using tools like mysqldump, and storing these backups in a designated directory.
Advanced versions of the script may include features like encrypting the backups for security, uploading them to remote storage services,
and implementing retention policies to delete older backups automatically. 
Logging mechanisms are also commonly integrated to record the success or failure of each backup operation, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.

update_server.sh
​The update_server.sh script is a Bash script designed to automate the process of updating a server's software and application code. 
Its primary function is to streamline routine maintenance tasks, 
ensuring that the server remains up-to-date with the latest software packages and application code from a version control system like Git.
 the script performs the following actions:​

Update System Packages.It runs commands like apt update and apt upgrade -y to fetch and install the latest versions of system packages.​

Pull Latest Code from GitHub: It navigates to the application's directory and executes git pull to retrieve the most recent code changes from the repository.​

Restart Services After updating the code, it restarts relevant services (e.g., web servers like Nginx or Apache) to apply the new changes.​

Logging: Throughout the process, the script logs its actions and any errors encountered to a log file, 
such as /var/log/update.log, 
with timestamps for easy tracking.
